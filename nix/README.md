# vkd3d-proton build interface

`default.nix` accepts schemaVersion 1, `pkgs`, explicit `sources`,
`dependencies`, `target`, `configuration` (release/debug) and `toolchain`.
It returns a derivation for native/cross outputs or a devbox dispatch record
for ABI constrained Windows targets. Dependencies are immutable Nix output
paths. Sources are exported snapshots, including selected gitlink contents.
Only locked toolchains are accepted (`toolchain = {}`); nonempty overrides
are refused. No recipe downloads dependencies during compilation.

The committed devenv inputs/lock match the environment workspace. From this
checkout run `devenv shell -- wb-component-build /path/to/spec.json`. The JSON
spec supplies system, schemaVersion, sources (`id: {path: ..., narHash: "sha256-..."}`), dependencies
(`id: /nix/store/...`), target and configuration explicitly. Nix therefore never
assumes the location of another checkout. The environment's `wb build` prepares
these snapshots and records full source/toolchain/artifact provenance.

Guest dispatch records require Stage 4's local disk mirror and durable elevated
backend. They are plans, with runtime verification pending; MinGW outputs cannot
substitute for an MSVC static engine. Licenses and debug symbols must accompany
exported artifacts.

The environment's engine targets use `cross-engine.nix` on Linux. Supply
`dependencies.msvcCrossFile`, `msvcSysroot`, `msvcInspector` and `hostWidl` from
the locked shared toolchain. Native WIDL generates matching Windows headers;
the seven MSVC archives retain `/MT`, generated bridge headers, embedded CodeView
symbols and architecture/CRT inspections. The root controller imports them into
the Windows UMD build.
